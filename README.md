# CSCI-101-Final-Project-M08
This is the git repo for my Computer Science final project in Module 8. The purpose of this project is to extract data and manipulate it using C++

The full description of the project: 
Using the data provided, process it and:
. determine the maximum x and y values
. create a 2D array initialized with spaces 
. fill the array with characters from the input data
. print the array to reveal the answer of block annotated letters 

Required documents:
. Flowchart to demonstrate step by step logic 
. UML to model the behavior and interactions of each step
. All source code 
. Screen Shot of final answer 
. Github url (optional but I will include) 

Within this repository are different folders containing different tasks required for the project including the initialization of my VS code.
